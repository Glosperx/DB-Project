# Kart Configurator

This project is a kart configurator built with **Java Spring Boot** for the backend and **React with Vite** for the frontend. The database is implemented in **Oracle SQL**, and the API allows managing kart models and equipment packages. The interface provides features for displaying, sorting, adding, and deleting items from tables.




# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
